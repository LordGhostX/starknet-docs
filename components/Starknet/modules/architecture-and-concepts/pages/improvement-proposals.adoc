link:https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs[Starknet Improvement Proposals (SNIPs)] are design documents that describe new features, improvements, and standards for the Starknet community. They include a detailed technical specification and rationale for the proposed changes and serve as the **source of truth** for the community.

[#importance_of_snips]
== Importance of SNIPs

SNIPs are important for the development and improvement of the Starknet ecosystem. Here are some of the reasons:

- **Structured Development**: SNIPs provide a formal and organized process for proposing new features, improvements, and standards, ensuring thorough review and discussion before implementation.
- **Community Involvement**: They encourage active participation from the Starknet community by allowing anyone to propose and discuss changes, leading to more robust and well-rounded development.
- **Transparency**: The SNIP process promotes transparency in decision-making, with all the proposals and discussions publicly documented and accessible.
- **Quality Assurance**: The review process for SNIPs checks for technical soundness, feasibility, and alignment with Starknet’s goals. This helps maintain the quality and reliability of new features and improvements.
- **Documentation and Standardization**: SNIPs are comprehensive documentation of all proposed and implemented changes, making integration easier for developers.
- **Future Planning**: SNIPs help shape the future of Starknet by providing a clear roadmap of proposed improvements and features, aligning and prioritizing development efforts with Starknet’s vision.

[#writing_a_snip]
== Writing a SNIP

Writing a SNIP involves following our guidelines to ensure your proposal is well-structured, clear, and ready for community review. The SNIP process is based on the link:https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1[Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) process]. Here’s how to get started:

1. Review and familiarize yourself with link:https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-1.md[SNIP-1]
2. Fork the link:https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs[SNIPs repository]
3. Use the link:https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/blob/main/SNIPS/snip-template.md[SNIP template] to create your SNIP.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) to the link:https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs[SNIPs repository] when your draft is complete.

Your first PR should be a draft of the final SNIP and must meet all formatting criteria, especially the correct metadata in the header. An editor reviews the PR, assigns it a number, and then merges it. Make sure you include a `discussions-to` header with the URL to a link:https://community.starknet.io/[forum] or link:https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs/issues/new/choose[GitHub issue] for community discussions.

[TIP]
====
Before you start writing your SNIP, it can be helpful to review well-crafted proposals from other ecosystems as they can provide insights into the structure, clarity, and detail needed to make your proposal effective.

It can also be helpful to engage with the community to receive feedback before formalizing your idea into a SNIP.
